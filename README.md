### Hi there, I'm Arno 👋

I'm a **System & Network Administration (ASIX)** student based in Catalonia, Spain, with a passion for building and securing real-world IT infrastructure.

My goal is to specialize in network engineering and cybersecurity.

### 🔭 I’m currently building:

Right now, my main focus is my **[Proxmox VE 9 Homelab Project](https://github.com/abrsc/my-homelab/)**. <br> <br>
I'm documenting the entire process of transforming a recycled PC into a full server stack, including:
* Proxmox 9 Installation & Debugging
* Network configuration (pfSense, VLANs)
* Service deployment (Pi-hole, Active Directory, Kali)

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:

* Advanced Networking (CCNA track)
* Linux System Administration
* Python for automation (monitoring & backups)
